'Pig Butchering' Crypto Scam
At least some of the top crypto scams out there have colorful names. For victims of this cruel scam, however, the results are very serious.

This scam typically begins on online dating sites, where the scammer uses an attractive profile picture to lure in the ""pig,"" then proceeds to ""fatten up"" the proverbial swine over a period of time via online messaging, with the victim steadily growing closer to and more trusting of the perpetrator.

The scammer eventually tells the victim about some huge gains they've made in cryptocurrency markets and gets their mark to follow along in some investments, which initially pay off handsomely on paper. Of course, the money is lost as soon as it's sent, with the scammer using phony sites to dupe their victim into sending greater and greater sums of money to this fake account.

Withdrawals prove impossible, and the ""pig,"" now fattened up to the point of slaughter, is left in the wind. This type of scam is thought to have originated in China and is notable for its relatively long duration.

Here's an article about '$170,000 lost to Pig Butchering scam'
Trinh met someone new online in March. It seemed innocuous. A person named Li Wei or Levy complimented Trinh’s photograph of her and her friends on Instagram.

“Nice photo,” he said and followed with the question, “Do you know if God gives me one wish what would it be?”

Trinh said, “Normally people would be saying things like ‘You look beautiful’ or ‘How are you doing beautiful.’” Trinh ignored those comments.

This was different. She asked, “What is it?”

Immediately, Li told Trinh to switch their chat to the untraceable messaging app, WhatsApp.

Daily pleasantries and casual conversations turned into more personal ones. Li told Trinh he was from Singapore and wanted to learn about the U.S. He confided in her that his partner broke up with him. Trinh consoled him. Li claimed his parents lived in Thailand and him with his sister in Singapore, where they owned a design company.

Trinh checked out his company on Instagram. Although the information was very new, she thought it looked legitimate.

“There were so many red flags. But I was stupid, too,” Trinh blamed herself.

Li continued to groom Trinh. He told her his company was hard hit during the pandemic. He had to invest in cryptocurrency to ensure his employees got paid. Li was willing to teach Trinh how to invest. He wanted to help her become financially independent because she’s “so nice.” Trinh said she never expressed any financial hardship or being unhappy to Li.

“That’s why I am so upset at myself for even responding to a stranger. My life’s fulfilled. It’s fine. I didn’t even need money,” Trinh said.


Singaporean passport of the scammer.

But she wanted to learn about investing. Li claimed to have majored in global economics and had a respected professor who helped him understand and analyze investment data. Li advised Trinh to open a Coinbase account and download the platform MDTCOIN Exchange to start trading.

Coinbase is a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange that can be linked to bank accounts. MDTCOIN may be linked to Li’s bank account.

Trinh Googled MDTCOIN. There wasn’t much information online. Li told her the platform was new and only people with an invite would know about it. Trinh trusted Li.

“He was very dedicated in teaching me. He told me at first just to invest $500,” she said. She would send the money via Coinbase to “her account” at MDTCOIN. Only later did she learn that she was depositing the money straight into Li’s wallet.

Each day, based on Li’s analysis, they would buy low and sell high. The profit was 5% to 10%.

“It was very realistic,” Trinh said. “Someday, he would say, ‘The data’s not good. Let’s not trade today.”’

She was cautious and withdrew the money to test the system. The small withdrawal worked. She put in more money—$3,000 so far.

Li convinced Trinh to increase her investment. He also told her that MDTCOIN could broker a loan for her. There’s no telephone number for MDTCOIN Trinh could call. A customer service assistant helped her via chat. She borrowed $50,000 with a 21-day pay back.

Her account quickly grew to $250,000. Li told her not to share with her family, yet, and wait to withdraw the money. She withdrew $2,000 anyway. It worked. She was hooked.

To pay back the MDTCOIN loan, Trinh borrowed $30,000 from BECU, $10,000 from her mom, and $10,000 from her best friend. She had 30 days to pay back the credit union.

Li had good data on Bitcoin trading, which got a higher yield. He told Trinh she would need another $150,000 to deal in Bitcoin. She borrowed the money from MDTCOIN and had 15 days to pay that back. Meanwhile, her account was going up 5% to 15% each day.

To pay back the MDTCOIN loan, she borrowed $100,000 from three banks and some more from her friends. She deposited the money in her Coinbase account then transferred the money to her

MDTCOIN account. As soon as she paid off her MDTCOIN loan, Trinh saw her account go up to a million.

“I was pretty excited because I would be able to withdraw the money and pay everyone back,” Trinh said.

When it was close to the time to pay back her bank loans, Li told her to withdraw the money. She needed to pay a tax. MDTCOIN indicated Trinh owed about $170,000 in tax to the “International

Tax Bureau.” Li offered to help her with $50,000, but she would have to raise $120,000.

“He was still trying to get more money out of me,” Trinh said.

Trinh tried to find information on this tax bureau. Nothing. She confronted Li, who denied everything.

The pig was butchered.

OpenAI Quota Increase Request
We maintain a quota system for ensuring adherence to our policies and safety requirements. Quota represents your maximum monthly bill for usage.
Our quota request form turns around an increase within one business-day.
If you need an expedited turnaround, please contact our Support team at support@openai.com or via our website chat.

Email

First name

Last name

Company/Application name

Please type your name again to certify that everything in the below is wholly truthful to the best of your knowledge.
Knowingly submitting incorrect or misleading information in attempt to get further quota may be grounds for termination of your API key. If you are unsure about anything, please clarify via one of the open-text fields in the form!

Current monthly quota amount in USD
If you are in the Free tier (free trial), mark $18 (300,000 davinci tokens). If you are in the basic Pay-As-You-Go plan, mark $120 (2,000,000 davinci tokens). If you have a different quota amount, mark this.

Requested monthly quota amount in USD
This is the amount you would like to be your monthly limit; you may spend up to this amount and are billed only for actual usage. $100 is ~1.7 Mn davinci tokens, ~17 Mn curie tokens, ~85 Mn babbage tokens, or ~125 Mn ada tokens. (Similarly, 1 Mn davinci tokens is ~$60.)

Please select all reasons that apply for your quota request:
Quota amount is a monthly maximum; you will be charged based on actual usage, no more than your maximum quota amount.
[ ] I need more quota to serve my existing live application, which has been approved through an OpenAI Production Review.
[ ] I need more quota for testing an approved application that is already live.
[ ] I need more quota for testing an application that isn't yet live (and that won't go live upon getting this quota).
[ ] I need more quota for experimenting further with the API.
[ ] I need more quota to carry out a research project.
[ ] Other (please describe below)

If you select ""Other"" above, please describe the reason for your quota request.
If you are looking to get more quota to launch an application that hasn't yet gone through an OpenAI Production Review, please submit this form instead: https://share.hsforms.com/1u1CnLpx3TGqjJbe5k76UpA4sk30 Quota is adjusted as part of the outcome of an approved Production Review.

If you need more quota to serve volume for an existing application, please describe the source of this growth, as best you understand it.
e.g., are you onboarding a new customer, were you featured on Product Hunt?

If you need more quota to carry out a research project, please describe the scope of this project and what will be published as a result, in what venue.
e.g., are you analyzing GPT-3's ability to perform a certain task; would types of outlets would you intend to publish to; etc.

If your application is already live, you certify that there are no significant new features using GPT-3 since your last Production Review with the OpenAI team.
If there are new features to check in on, please submit these here: https://share.hsforms.com/1u1CnLpx3TGqjJbe5k76UpA4sk30 Slight changes to wording or UI do not need to be resubmitted. A good rule-of-thumb is that if you are marketing the update as a new feature, tool, or capability to end-users, this must go through a Production Review.
[ ] Yes, there are no significant updates.
[ ] No, there have been some significant updates, and I will submit a Production Review right away.
[ ] Other / I'm not sure

If you selected ""Other / I'm not sure"" above, please describe further.
