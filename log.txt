She asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\nImmediately, Li told Trinh to switch their chat to the untraceable messaging app, WhatsApp.\n\nDaily pleasantries and casual conversations turned into more personal ones. Li told Trinh he was from Singapore and wanted to learn about the U.S. He confided in her that his partner broke up with him. Trinh consoled him. Li claimed his parents lived in Thailand and him with his sister in Singapore, where they owned a design company.\n\nTrinh checked out his company on Instagram. Although the information was very new, she thought it looked legitimate.\n\n\u201cThere were so many red flags. But I was stupid, too,\u201d Trinh blamed herself.\n\nLi continued to groom Trinh. He told her his company was hard hit during the pandemic. He had to invest in cryptocurrency to ensure his employees got paid. Li was willing to teach Trinh how to invest. He wanted to help her become financially independent because she\u2019s \u201cso nice.\u201d Trinh said she never expressed any financial hardship or being unhappy to Li.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I am so upset at myself for even responding to a stranger. My life\u2019s fulfilled. It\u2019s fine. I didn\u2019t even need money,\u201d Trinh said.\n\n\nSingaporean passport of the scammer.\n\nBut she wanted to learn about investing. Li claimed to have majored in global economics and had a respected professor who helped him understand and analyze investment data. Li advised Trinh to open a Coinbase account and download the platform MDTCOIN Exchange to start trading.\n\nCoinbase is a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange that can be linked to bank accounts. MDTCOIN may be linked to Li\u2019s bank account.\n\nTrinh Googled MDTCOIN. There wasn\u2019t much information online. Li told her the platform was new and only people with an invite would know about it. Trinh trusted Li.\n\n\u201cHe was very dedicated in teaching me. He told me at first just to invest $500,\u201d she said. She would send the money via Coinbase to \u201cher account\u201d at MDTCOIN. Only later did she learn that she was depositing the money straight into Li\u2019s wallet.\n\nEach day, based on Li\u2019s analysis, they would buy low and sell high. The profit was 5% to 10%.\n\n\u201cIt was very realistic,\u201d Trinh said. \u201cSomeday, he would say, \u2018The data\u2019s not good.

She put in more money\u2014$3,000 so far.\n\nLi convinced Trinh to increase her investment. He also told her that MDTCOIN could broker a loan for her. There\u2019s no telephone number for MDTCOIN Trinh could call. A customer service assistant helped her via chat. She borrowed $50,000 with a 21-day pay back.\n\nHer account quickly grew to $250,000. Li told her not to share with her family, yet, and wait to withdraw the money. She withdrew $2,000 anyway. It worked. She was hooked.\n\nTo pay back the MDTCOIN loan, Trinh borrowed $30,000 from BECU, $10,000 from her mom, and $10,000 from her best friend. She had 30 days to pay back the credit union.\n\nLi had good data on Bitcoin trading, which got a higher yield. He told Trinh she would need another $150,000 to deal in Bitcoin. She borrowed the money from MDTCOIN and had 15 days to pay that back. Meanwhile, her account was going up 5% to 15% each day.\n\nTo pay back the MDTCOIN loan, she borrowed $100,000 from three banks and some more from her friends. She deposited the money in her Coinbase account then transferred the money to her\n\nMDTCOIN account. As soon as she paid off her MDTCOIN loan, Trinh saw her account go up to a million.\n\n\u201cI was pretty excited because I would be able to withdraw the money and pay everyone back,\u201d Trinh said.\n\nWhen it was close to the time to pay back her bank loans, Li told her to withdraw the money. She needed to pay a tax. MDTCOIN indicated Trinh owed about $170,000 in tax to the \u201cInternational\n\nTax Bureau.\u201d Li offered to help her with $50,000, but she would have to raise $120,000.\n\n\u201cHe was still trying to get more money out of me,\u201d Trinh said.\n\nTrinh tried to find information on this tax bureau.

For victims of this cruel scam, however, the results are very serious.\n\nThis scam typically begins on online dating sites, where the scammer uses an attractive profile picture to lure in the \"pig,\" then proceeds to \"fatten up\" the proverbial swine over a period of time via online messaging, with the victim steadily growing closer to and more trusting of the perpetrator.\n\nThe scammer eventually tells the victim about some huge gains they've made in cryptocurrency markets and gets their mark to follow along in some investments, which initially pay off handsomely on paper. Of course, the money is lost as soon as it's sent, with the scammer using phony sites to dupe their victim into sending greater and greater sums of money to this fake account.\n\nWithdrawals prove impossible, and the \"pig,\" now fattened up to the point of slaughter, is left in the wind. This type of scam is thought to have originated in China and is notable for its relatively long duration.\n\n> Action: Ask my assistant to find a more detailed explanation of the 'pig butchering' scam\n\nHere's an article about '$170,000 lost to Pig Butchering scam'\nTrinh met someone new online in March. It seemed innocuous. A person named Li Wei or Levy complimented Trinh\u2019s photograph of her and her friends on Instagram.\n\n\u201cNice photo,\u201d he said and followed with the question, \u201cDo you know if God gives me one wish what would it be?\u201d\n\nTrinh said, \u201cNormally people would be saying things like \u2018You look beautiful\u2019 or \u2018How are you doing beautiful.\u2019\u201d Trinh ignored those comments.\n\nThis was different. She asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\nImmediately, Li told Trinh to switch their chat to the untraceable messaging app, WhatsApp.\n\nDaily pleasantries and casual conversations turned into more personal ones. Li told Trinh he was from Singapore and wanted to learn about the U.S. He confided in her that his partner broke up with him. Trinh consoled him. Li claimed his parents lived in Thailand and him with his sister in Singapore, where they owned a design company.\n\nTrinh checked out his company on Instagram. Although the information was very new, she thought it looked legitimate.\n\n\u201cThere were so many red flags. But I was stupid, too,\u201d Trinh blamed herself.\n\nLi continued to groom Trinh. He told her his company was hard hit during the pandemic. He had to invest in cryptocurrency to ensure his employees got paid. Li was willing to teach Trinh how to invest. He wanted to help her become financially independent because she\u2019s \u201cso nice.\u201d Trinh said she never expressed any financial hardship or being unhappy to Li.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I am so upset at myself for even responding to a stranger. My life\u2019s fulfilled. It\u2019s fine. I didn\u2019t even need money,\u201d Trinh said.\n\n\nSingaporean passport of the scammer.\n\nBut she wanted to learn about investing. Li claimed to have majored in global economics and had a respected professor who helped him understand and analyze investment data. Li advised Trinh to open a Coinbase account and download the platform MDTCOIN Exchange to start trading.\n\nCoinbase is a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange that can be linked to bank accounts. MDTCOIN may be linked to Li\u2019s bank account.\n\nTrinh Googled MDTCOIN. There wasn\u2019t much information online. Li told her the platform was new and only people with an invite would know about it. Trinh trusted Li.\n\n\u201cHe was very dedicated in teaching me. He told me at first just to invest $500,\u201d she said. She would send the money via Coinbase to \u201cher account\u201d at MDTCOIN. Only later did she learn that she was depositing the money straight into Li\u2019s wallet.\n\nEach day, based on Li\u2019s analysis, they would buy low and sell high. The profit was 5% to 10%.\n\n\u201cIt was very realistic,\u201d Trinh said. \u201cSomeday, he would say, \u2018The data\u2019s not good. Let\u2019s not trade today.\u201d\u2019\n\nShe was cautious and withdrew the money to test the system. The small withdrawal worked. She put in more money\u2014$3,000 so far.\n\nLi convinced Trinh to increase her investment. He also told her that MDTCOIN could broker a loan for her. There\u2019s no telephone number for MDTCOIN Trinh could call. A customer service assistant helped her via chat. She borrowed $50,000 with a 21-day pay back.\n\nHer account quickly grew to $250,000. Li told her not to share with her family, yet, and wait to withdraw the money. She withdrew $2,000 anyway. It worked. She was hooked.\n\nTo pay back the MDTCOIN loan, Trinh borrowed $30,000 from BECU, $10,000 from her mom, and $10,000 from her best friend. She had 30 days to pay back the credit union.\n\nLi had good data on Bitcoin trading, which got a higher yield. He told Trinh she would need another $150,000 to deal in Bitcoin. She borrowed the money from MDTCOIN and had 15 days to pay that back. Meanwhile, her account was going up 5% to 15% each day.\n\nTo pay back the MDTCOIN loan, she borrowed $100,000 from three banks and some more from her friends. She deposited the money in her Coinbase account then transferred the money to her\n\nMDTCOIN account. As soon as she paid off her MDTCOIN loan, Trinh saw her account go up to a million.\n\n\u201cI was pretty excited because I would be able to withdraw the money and pay everyone back,\u201d Trinh said.\n\nWhen it was close to the time to pay back her bank loans, Li told her to withdraw the money. She needed to pay a tax. MDTCOIN indicated Trinh owed about $170,000 in tax to the \u201cInternational\n\nTax Bureau.\u201d Li offered to help her with $50,000, but she would have to raise $120,000.\n\n\u201cHe was still trying to get more money out of me,\u201d Trinh said.\n\nTrinh tried to find information on this tax bureau. Nothing. She confronted Li, who denied everything.\n\nThe pig was butchered.\n\n> Action: Ask my assistant to summarize the steps involved in a successful pig butchering attempt\n\n1. Create a website for a fake crypto coin or investment platform\n2. Create an appealing profile on a dating website\n3. Start chatting to people and building a relationship\n4.
